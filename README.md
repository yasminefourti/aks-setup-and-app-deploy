# Create an AKS Cluster and Deploy Applications

### Introduction

Welcome to the "Create an AKS Cluster and Deploy Applications" lab! This project is designed to guide you through the process of setting up an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster and deploying applications using modern DevOps tools. In this lab, you will:

1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet) for AKS**  
   Set up a Virtual Network to enable secure and efficient communication within your AKS environment.

2. **Provision an AKS Cluster**  
   Use Terraform to create a managed Kubernetes cluster that will host your containerized applications.

3. **Deploy Flux CD Using Helm**  
   Install Flux CD with Helm to implement GitOps practices for continuous delivery.

4. **Deploy an Application Using Flux CD**  
   Automate the deployment and management of your application within the AKS cluster using Flux CD.

By the end of this lab, you will have hands-on experience with provisioning an AKS cluster and automating application deployments using Flux CD, equipping you with essential skills for modern cloud-native application management.
